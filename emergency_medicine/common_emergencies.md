## Heat illnesses

- group of disorders
- failure in thermoregulation *normally the body regulates body temperature at normal even when the outside temperature is hot*
- usually occurs during extreme heat/humidity
- may occur in athletes during hot weather

### Heat cramp

- mildest form of heat illness


- exercise-associated muscle cramps
- probably unrelated to temperature
- treatment:
  - hydration
  - replace sodium losses (sports drinks)
  - stretch and massage muscle 

### Heat syncope

- syncope due to exposure to high temperatures
- body temperature **normal or mildly increased** *if a patient collapses, and their body temperature is very high, this is heat injury*
- exertional or non-exertional *forms of heat syncope*
- treatment: cooling, rehydration
- must exclude other causes of syncope *to confirm diagnosis of heat syncope*

#### Exertional heat syncope

- occurs at **cessation of exercise activity**
  - syncope *during* exercise: red flag for cardiac disease
- common with endurance exercise (e.g., marathon)
- vasodilation during exercise *in skin as the body tries to dissipate heat*
- cessation → abrupt loss of muscle pressure on veins → sudden decrease in venous return → drop in cardiac output

#### Non-exertional heat syncope

- syncope when exposed to high temperatures
- diffuse vasodilation to dissipate heat
- fall in blood pressure → syncope

## Heat exhaustion

- inability to continue exercise in heat
- temperature usually between 101 - 104 *usually not above 104*
- caused by **inadequate cardiac output**
  - decreased circulating volume *increase in peripheral dilation during exercise can be a contributing factor*
- absence of neurologic dysfunction (e.g., confusion, memory loss, problem with concentration, mood changes) *presence suggests heat injury or heat stroke*
- treatment: cooling, rehydration

## Heat injury

- organ damage due to hyperthermia
- presents as **collapse during exercise**
- temperature > 104
- renal failure
- acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
- if heat injury causes central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction: heat stroke *special form of heat injury*
- treatment
  - **cooling** *(because heat injury involves body temperature > 104 F, it is important to lower the body temperature by specific methods of cooling)*
    - cool room
    - cold water
    - cold water compresses 
    - **evaporative therapy**
      - highly effective treatment for hyperthermia
      - patient disrobed
      - sprayed with lukewarm water mist
      - fan blows air over moist skin
      - used in heat injury and heat stroke
    - **cold water immersion**
      - not always available
      - can be harmful to elderly patients
  - fluid and electrolyte replacement
  - specific treatment for organ dysfunction
    - renal failure
    - ARDS
    - DIC

### Heat stroke

- **collapse during exercise**
- requires temperature > 104 F
- central nervous system dysfunction *required for diagnosis of heat stroke, and not other forms of heat injury*
  - usually encephalopathy (confusion and disorientation)
- may involve other organs *(i.e., heat injury to other organs besides the brain)*

#### Exertional heat stroke

- **collapse** that occurs *during* exercise
- often occurs in young, healthy athletes *that pushed themselves too far (over-exertion)*
- *very high body temperatures*
- *evidence of central nervous system dysfunction*
- *differential diagnosis: cardiac syncope*

#### Non-exertional heat stroke

- usually affects older patients (often over 70)
- impaired ability to thermoregulate *related to chronic disease*
- underlying cardiovascular or neurologic disease
- may have obesity or physical disability
- often on medications (beta-blockers, anti-cholinergics)

## Hypothermia

- temperature < 95 F (35 C)
- may be caused by exposure to cold environment
  - outdoor exposure or cold water
- many medical causes: sepsis, hypothyroidism *lowers body temperature due to: (look up)*
- treatment
  - warming
    - **passive external warming**
      - used in mild hypothermia
      - remove wet clothing
      - blankets to limit heat loss
      - shivering generates heat
    - **active external warming**
      - moderate to severe hypothermia
      - warm blankets
      - heating pads
    - **active internal warming**
      - used in severe hypothermia
      - warmed oxygen
      - heated IV infusions
      - irrigation of peritoneal/pleural cavities *with warm fluids to raise the body temperature*

**Varying degrees of severity in hypothermia**
